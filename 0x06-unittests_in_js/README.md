# 0x06. Unittests in JS
## Tasks
### 0. Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library
Install Mocha using npm:

+ Set up a scripts in your package.json to quickly run Mocha using npm test
+ You have to use assert
+ Create a new file named 0-calcul.js:

Create a function named calculateNumber. It should accepts two arguments (number) a and b
+ The function should round a and b and return the sum of it
+ Test cases

Create a file 0-calcul.test.js that contains test cases of this function
+ You can assume a and b are always number
+ Tests should be around the “rounded” part
Tips:

+ For the sake of the example, this test suite is slightly extreme and probably not needed
+ However, remember that your tests should not only verify what a function is supposed to do, but also the edge cases
Requirements:

+ You have to use assert
+ You should be able to run the test suite using npm test 0-calcul.test.js
+ Every test should pass without any warning
